Welcome to my rendition of the write-everday-challenge! My goal with this blog is to challenge myself to commit writing somenthing––whether it be a reflection, a poem, or movie review–- for 365 days.

There are several reasons why I am pursuing this challenge:
1. Self-exploration
2. Document my thoughts/emotions/experiences at this point in my life
3. Simply to write more!
